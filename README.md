Repo for project on Federated Learning for ECE 6254: Statistical Machine Learning.

Forked from the following repo: https://github.com/AshwinRJ/Federated-Learning-PyTorch where the FedAVG algorithm has been implemented (see paper: [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)).
